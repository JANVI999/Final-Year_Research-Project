1. Innovative Concept / Idea: 
The innovative concept behind our project lies in utilizing real time remote sensing data from the AQUA-MODIS satellite to monitor water quality by detecting Harmful Algal Blooms. We have developed a system that collects real-time satellite data. We have taken into consideration the following parameters: chlorophyll-a concentration and Sea Surface Temperature. By leveraging a deep learning UNet architecture, we are able to accurately segment the areas with high chlorophyll-a and Sea Surface Temperature (SST) concentrations. This approach provides a comprehensive and efficient method for assessing water quality and detecting Harmful Algal Blooms (HABs) in real-time, contributing significantly to environmental monitoring and ecosystem health.

2. Advantages / Applications: 
The project offers several advantages and applications. Firstly, it enables continuous and real-time monitoring of water quality, allowing for early detection of HABs and potential water contamination. This is crucial for maintaining the health of aquatic ecosystems and ensuring public safety regarding water consumption. Additionally, the scalable nature of our approach makes it applicable to various geographical locations, providing a valuable tool for environmental researchers, policymakers, and water management authorities.
It supports the economic sustainability of industries reliant on clean water sources, such as tourism, fisheries and agriculture.

3. Science and Working Principle behind the Idea: 
The project combines principles of remote sensing, deep learning, and environmental science. Satellite data from AQUA-MODIS is used to extract chlorophyll-a and SST information, which are key indicators of water quality and HAB presence. The deep learning model, i.e UNET architecture, is trained to analyze these data layers and accurately predict areas of high chlorophyll-a and SST concentrations. This process involves data preprocessing, segmentation, and model evaluation, ensuring robust and reliable results.

4. Final Outcome / Deliverable of the Project: 
Our system accurately detects and monitors the presence of HABs in water bodies. This includes a trained UNET model capable of analyzing satellite images, predicting chlorophyll-a concentrations and SST levels, and highlighting areas of potential HABs. The project also provides visualization tools for better understanding and interpretation of the results, facilitating informed decision-making regarding water resource management and environmental protection. Our scalable approach contributes to comprehensive solutions for  preserving marine ecosystems, public health, and water-dependent industries worldwide.

7. Advantages to Society / Community: 
Our project has significant advantages for society and the community. By improving water quality monitoring and HAB detection, we contribute to the preservation of marine ecosystems, safeguard public health, and support water-dependent industries such as fisheries and tourism. The timely detection of HABs also allows for prompt mitigation measures, reducing the impact of water contamination events and ensuring sustainable water resources for future generations. The remote sensing approach equips decision-makers with valuable insights. This information supports the implementation of adaptive management strategies, ensuring that responses to environmental challenges, particularly HAB events, are well-informed and tailored to specific conditions. This approach ensures societal well-being and the long-term sustainability of communities and natural resources. Overall, our project benefits both local communities and global efforts towards environmental conservation.
